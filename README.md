# Astromech2-3-2040
Software for controlling 2-3-2 transitions on 3D printed Astromech Droids using Pimoroni Servo2040

## Overview
The Astromech2-3-2040 library is intended for use with the KENARDO 2-3-2 3D printed Astromech droid legs, designed for compatibility with the Mr.Baddeley Printed Droid MkIII body. This software, running on a Pimoroni Servo2040, handles the kinematics of the transition from 2 to 3 leg modes and back, as well as providing an interface for further puppeteering via an i2c serial interface. This module only handles the actuators and sensors related to the 2-3-2 mechanism, and requires an additional offboard controller for user interaction.
